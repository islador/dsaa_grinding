Is there any point to defining rivers?

What could the algo look like? Do we start a search for high points then calculate from there? What about low points and calculate up?

It appears that water _does_ flow from high to low / same in equal portion. So it's not that water _only_ flows to the lowest of the surrounding squares touching it, it's that water _always_ flows to _all_ same or lower squares.

[[9,9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9,9]]

In the below scenario, because water flows equally to all squares, we would return all squares
[
  [9,9,9,9,9],
  [9,9,9,9,9],
  [9,9,9,9,9]
]

In the below scenario, because water flows equally to all same squares, we'd return everything except the center 8,7,8 squares because the water is "trapped" there. It's an inland lake.
[
  [9,9,9,9,9],
  [9,8,7,8,9],
  [9,9,9,9,9]
]

In the below we have an inland "river", where water flows from all the 9's into the center "lake" and then out into the bottom of the grid (Atlantic). In this case we return all cells because again, the water flows across all the 9's (which are ubroken) evenly.
[
  [9,9,9,9,9],
  [9,8,7,8,9],
  [9,9,6,9,9]
]

In the below we return everything in the top row as it flows into both, we return the first two 8's on the second row as they flow into both, but the rest of the matrix drains only into the atlantic.
[
  [9,9,9,9,9],
  [8,8,7,8,8],
  [9,9,6,9,9]
]

Each cell has a relation to the other in height, but also in what it connects to elsewhere. The downstream connections are ultimately what we're looking for, and those connections aren't linear, they're many to many.

There's a concept of "Flow Paths", where water flows. Can we model flow paths as where a single drop goes? Seeking lower energy? But we'd want to branch in our search since each square can have up to four flow paths.

In the below case we would return all but the top left and bottom right 7's.

  [7,8,7],
  [8,9,8],
  [7,8,7]
]

We can assert that each cell has up to four flow directions, and each flow direction has a destination (Pac or Atl).

The top right and bottom left always have two flow directions and two destinations. We can calculate each flow direction by checking each cell around the current cell. We can determine the destination of a given flow direction by checking each cell's flow destination. If we start at the edges and work in we have no problem with this.

Our algorithm should work "clockwise" from the top right around the matrix.

Steps
1. Start in the top right cell and iterate through all the cells in a clockwise fashion.
2. Determine the cell's flow directions by inspecting the cell's directly adjacent to the current cell
  2a. A cell flows right if the cell above it is the same or lower value the current cell.
  2b. A cell flows down if the cell above it is the same or lower value the current cell.
  2c. A cell flows left if the cell above it is the same or lower value the current cell.
  2d. A cell flows up if the cell above it is the same or lower value the current cell.
3. Determine the cell's flow destination by inspecting the cell's directly adjacent to the current cell and their flow destination's
  3a. A cell has a flow destination of the pacific if any cell it flows into has a flow destination of the pacific
  3b. A cell has a flow destination of the atlantic if any cell it flows into has a flow destination of the atlantic
  3c. A cell has a flow destination of the pacific if it borders the top or left side of the matrix
  3d. A cell has a flow destination of the atlantic if it borders the right or bottom of the matrix
4. Return the coordinates of all cells that have a flow destination of both pacific and atlantic


Clockwise Algorithm - Assume the matrix is always square
1. Move to the right until you encounter a previously visited cell or the edge of the matrix.
2. Move down until you encounter a previously visited cell or the edge of the matrix.
3. Move left until you encounter a previously visited cell or the edge of the matrix.
4. Move up until you encounter a previously visited cell or the edge of the matrix.

My algo is incorrect, and possibly fundamentally wrong. I'm doing a single spiral pass and evaluating flow destinations a single time. However each flow destination caculated impacts _all_ other flow destinations. Right now all previously computed flow destinations are reflected in the currently evaluated cell's flow destination, but when a new cell's destinations are calculated they aren't back propagated to the previous cells.

How can I back-propagate these destinations?

My original implementation had the notion of tracking flow directions. These can be reversed and used as a way to trace flows backwards each time a flow destination is calculated.

What would that data structure look like?

A dictionary in 2d matrix called flow_properties
The dictionary could denote the following: flow_properties = {flow_directions:{"right": True, "down": True, "left": True, "up": True}, is_adjacent_cell_off_matrix:{"right": False, "down": False, "left": False, "up": False}}

DONE - We can populate the above matrix during initial provisioning, with all false values.

DONE - In find_flow_destinations_for_current_position when a border cell is detected we can merge update that cell's flow_properties[is_adjacent_cell_off_matrix]. [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]

DONE - In find_flow_destinations_for_current_position when we compute a flow direction we can merge update that cell's flow_properties[flow_directions]. Tested with [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]

In find_flow_destinations_for_current_position, when we're done calculating a given cell's flow_destinations and storing them, we can traverse that cell's flow_directions and update all of their flow_destinations.
* This is almost recursive, but not quite.


[
  00 {'Atlantic': False, 'Pacific': False, 'cell_position': [1, 0]},
    01 {'Atlantic': False, 'Pacific': False, 'cell_position': [0, 2]},
    02 {'Atlantic': False, 'Pacific': False, 'cell_position': [1, 2]},
    10 {'Atlantic': True, 'Pacific': False, 'cell_position': [1, 0]},
    11 {'Atlantic': False, 'Pacific': False, 'cell_position': [1, 0]},
    12 {'Atlantic': False, 'Pacific': False, 'cell_position': [2, 2]},
    20 {'Atlantic': True, 'Pacific': False, 'cell_position': [1, 0]},
    21 {'Atlantic': True, 'Pacific': False, 'cell_position': [2, 0]},
    22 {'Atlantic': True, 'Pacific': False, 'cell_position': [2, 1]}
]

Ok, so this is just... wrong. The storage array is supposed to be flat
* Why are the cell positions wrong?
  * They're encoding twice for some reason, which is probably the root of the bug. (1,0 appears 3 times while 0,0 is never shown)
  * I believe add_flow_destination_for_current_position is correct, since it's purely a pass through.
    * This means that how we're calculating the values is wrong. Which makes sense.

For the 00 cell in this matrix I should have four calls to the update flow destinations function, two should be outside, two inside, and trues shouldn't get stepped on. The problem is that my trues are getting stepped on.

When I check an adjacent cell that I haven't yet calculated, I have a default of false false, and I propagate those values. In this manner I deconstruct the stored value as I move forward instead of building it up.

Should I ignore unvisited cells' data? It hasn't been computed yet, so it's garbage.

At first glance it appears the current error is a lack of back-propagation, and cell storage values are also wrong. These cell storage values denote when the last update occured? Fixing cell storage would be a good red herring fix.

1. Fix cell storage
2. Add in back propagation -> In find_flow_destinations_for_current_position, when we're done calculating a given cell's flow_destinations and storing them, we can traverse that cell's flow_directions and update all of their flow_destinations.

In find_flow_destinations_for_current_position, when we're done calculating a given cell's flow_destinations and storing them, we can traverse that cell's flow_directions and update all of their flow_destinations.

Ok, at the end of the traverse I have flow_properties["flow_directions"] that denotes where each cell flows to.

As part of not propagating unvisited cell's data into the existing cell's...

Man, doing this iteratively was like really hard. I bet recursion would've been far better here. Fucking recursion just crushes these matrix problems doesn't it?

What if I just reversed the algo and retraversed it? That would likely resolve this whole thing.

In the current solution every cell, except the last, has incomplete information during traversal because at least the next cell to be processed is missing. This means that as we carry the Flow Destinations along, we're always missing some.

If the first loop recorded only the flow destinations that lead to the ocean, and recorded the flow directions, we could spiral in repeatedly, by shrinking th spiral on each subsequent loop.

So Loop 1 runs the outer ring and calculates the flow directions and flow destinations.
Loop 2 runs the next ring and calculates the flow directions and flow destinations.

[
  [9,9,9,9,9],
  [9,8,7,8,9],
  [9,9,9,9,9]
]

Loop 1 would set the outer ring to pac/atl
Loop 2 would set the inner 3 cells to nothing

[
  [9,9,9,9,9],
  [9,10,11,10,9],
  [9,9,9,9,9]
]

Loop 1 would set the outer ring to pac/atl
Loop 2 would set the inner 3 cells to nothing


This is a bad idea. I'm too brain dead.

In the current solution every cell, except the last, has incomplete information during traversal because at least the next cell to be processed is missing. This means that as we carry the Flow Destinations along, we're always missing some. At the very least each cell must be recomputed based on previously discovered data, this is very hard to do in an iterative fashion.

Idea:
1. order all values from lowest to highest
2. compute the flow_sources for each cell, in order, from lowest to highest and store them as an array of inputs
  e.g in the below, 1,1 would have four inputs (counterclockwise) [[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[1,2]], meanwhile 0,0 would have [[0,1],[1,0]]
  2,2,2
  2,1,2
  2,2,2
  AH! This is the problem with an iterative solution, the number of passes is equal to the number of cells with the same value, which means its something like the number of rows times the number of columns. In this case 9 passes. God that's awful.
