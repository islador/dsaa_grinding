# Prompt
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements within the array.

The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique.

You may return the output in any order.

# Notes - Playing with the system to confirm edges

Ok, so with [1,2,3,4,5] and k of 1, we return 1, which is... confusing?

Ok, so with [1,2,3,4,5] and k of 3, we return [1,2,3], so there's a bias towards first in the array?

nums=[7,7,7,8,8,9]
k=1
yields [7]

# Implementation Thoughts pre-solution review
Well, we need to count the frequency with which every number is present in the input, so that's going to cost N no matter what.

We also need a way to keep a list of the X most common values in the array. So we'll probably want a way to track the frequency of every number and a way to keep track of the top X numbers.

Maybe an array called topNumbers [number,number,number] and a map called numberFrequency {number: appearanceCount}?

We iterate over the list and keep a count of frequency in the numberFrequency map (e.g. {3: 2, 2:5, 7:9}), and each time we increment a numberFrequency value we check to see if the appearanceCount > the lowest number in topNumbers. If it is, we swap the lowest number in topNumber for the currentNumber from the list.

There's also probably an optimization in knowing where we are in the list, e.g. if the list has 4 values and the first 3 are the same, and we're looking for the first most frequent, we can stop processing.

In this proposed algo I only iterate the list once, and I need to keep the topNumber array in order, but numberFrequency is a map with constant access times, so I don't care there. The performance here is likely N*Klogk where k is the number of integers expected to be returned and thus kept in the topNumbers array.

Now lets look at the solution.

# Solution Notes

Huh, so you can use a heap to implement a priority queue, this improves the efficiency of my topNumbers array by not having to keep reordering it. It gets it down to KlogN which is pretty damn good.

Apparently there's a linear time solution though?

Ok, so the way he's explaining it is linear time + 3N space.
N space for the original list
2N space for the ordered count, since we have an array of N size containing potentially an array of N size
unique(N) space for the counted values

You iterate through the list and count everything storing them in a map called numberFrequency composed of the number : countFrequency (e.g. {3:2, 2:5, 7:9}) This is constant time + unique(N) space.

Then you iterate through the countFrequency map (unique(N) time) and build the orderedCount arrays.

Then you iterate through the orderedCount arrays a minimum of K accesses, but possibly as much as N+K accesses.

Honestly, I'm not sure if this is as efficient as described? It's certainly space intensive.
