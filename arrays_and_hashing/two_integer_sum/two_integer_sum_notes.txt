Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

Return the location of two numbers in the array that equal the target but aren't the same number. Return the answer with the smaller index first.

nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,6]
target = 6
Result [1 (2), 4 (4)], not [2 (3), 3 (3)]

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.
* This assumption means that this is fundamentally a search problem.
* Can I operate this search such that i only iterate over the array twice?

Possible solutions:
Brute Force:
1. start with a number, subtract it from the target, then search the nums array for the result. If found, and not equal to the number, return the start number and the found number.
Computation: n^n?
Memory: Constant

Alternative - Trade memory:
What if I did the same algo, but I did it more?
soughtAddends = new Map()
seenNumbers = new Map()
for number of nums:
0. soughtAddend = target - number
1. if soughtAdden != number:
  2. if soughtAddends wants the number we're looking at
        return the locations for the number that sought this number and this number's location
  3. elif seenNumbers has the soughtAddend we're looking for:
        return the location for the number that this number sought and this number's location, sort them prior
  4. else:
      store the location of this number and its sought number

# How do we ensure we don't return the same number? Where should that check occur? Move that to phase 2
  * We should probably do the calculation and then reject it

# What is the computational complexity of this?
N array access and 2N hash access, so just 3N?

# What is the memory cost?
Worst case is 3N (nums array + soughtAddends + seenNumbers)

3. 9-3 = 6, inputNumber != soughtAddend -> seenNumbers doesn't have 6, soughtAddends doesn't have 3 -> seenNumbers has 3, so don't store, soughtAddend has 6, so don't store

5. 9-4 = 5, inputNumber != soughtAddend -> seenNumbers doesn't have 5, soughtAddends doesn't have 4 -> -> seenNumbers has 4, so don't store, soughtAddend has 5, so don't store

Interesting note: It seems that you could reduce the frequency of worst case performance with a randomization of the nums array, that wouldn't reduce worst case costs and might actually increase the average, but it would also make worst case much much rarer.
