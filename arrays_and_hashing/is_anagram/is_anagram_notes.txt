Assumptions:
1. Two strings of the same length
2. No malicious input

s and t
I shouldn't need any extra memory since I should be able to compare the strings, character by character, against each other.

Start at the left of s and the right of t and work in opposite directions.
S goes left to right
T goes right to left
Compare each character
If they aren't the same, return false
If you get to the end and haven't returned false, return true.

How the hell do you do string comparison like that in JS?
